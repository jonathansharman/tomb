Have objects with various properties slide across the screen
When they reach the edge, you take damage
Egyptian curse theme
Properties:
	color: red, green, blue, yellow
	species ideas: mummy, cobra, scarab
		backup ideas: cat, scorpion, statue, grave robber, crocodile
	motion: straight, vibrate, meander
	size/speed: small/fast, medium/medium, big/slow (bigger does more damage)
Put some buttons on the screen that instantly kill all objects with a particular property
	E.g. kill all reds, kill all squares, kill all rumblers
	There will be a limited selection of options at a time
Whenever a button is pressed, randomize all options and place the buttons on cooldown
Strategic considerations (aka the fun of the game)
	tradeoff between killing more enemies and killing enemies closer to the edge of the screen
If this isn't interesting enough, I could assign randomized cooldown costs to the buttons as well
Scoring and difficulty ramp:
	Score goes up over time. Survive as long as you can.
Could include a "mulligan" button that incurs a very short cooldown and just refreshes the options
	Maybe you don't get new options *until* this is pressed
Turns
	Turns proceed on a timer
	Enemies spawn on tiles
	Enemies move forward one tile per turn, unless they are slow (use icon to indicate turns until move)
		perhaps two tiles if they are unusually fast
	Cards cost a certain number of turns


Okay okay okay, hear me out. This thing should be a full-on roguelike deckbuilder a la STS.
	Fight your way into and then out of - or maybe just out of - a tomb, stealing treasure along the way
	Relics = cards
	Start in a basic fight, then branch out and back in towards the goal - the exit
		You can see which kinds of enenies you'll face and which rewards you might get before choosing your path

Resources
	Time/turns
	Cards
	Gold?
	Maat/Isfet balance
		More Isfet = more frequent/stronger/faster enemies?
